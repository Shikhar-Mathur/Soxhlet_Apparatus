                        Soxhlet extraction is a modern extraction technique in which we circulate the same solvent through the extractor several times. Soxhlet extractor extracts the components using the condensed vapours of the solvent. The condensed vapors come in contact with the sample powder and support and the soluble part in powder gets mixed with solvent.

            <li>The solvent is heated to reflux.  </li> <br> 
            <li>The solvent vapor travels up a distillation arm and floods into the chamber housing the thimble of solid. </li> <br>
            <li>The condenser ensures that any solvent vapour cools, and drips back down into the chamber housing the solid material.            </li> <br>
            <li>The chamber containing the solid material slowly fills with warm solvent. Some of the desired compound will then dissolve in the warm solvent. </li> <br>
            <li>When the Soxhlet chamber is almost full, the chamber is automatically emptied by a siphon side arm, with the solvent running back down to the distillation flask.</li><br>
            <li>This cycle may be allowed to repeat many times, over hours or days.</li><br>
            <li>During each cycle, a portion of the non-volatile compound dissolves in the solvent.</li><br>
            <li>After many cycles the desired compound is concentrated in the distillation flask.</li><br>
            <li>After extraction the solvent is removed, by means of a rotary evaporator, yielding the extracted compound.            </li><br>
